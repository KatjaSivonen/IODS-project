I don't know how well I'll do but I'm expecting to learn a lot of new things about R and open data science. I learned about the course when Kimmo recommended it to me. 

The exercise set was a great introduction to R tools and Rstudio. I found the operators for filtering data to be the most interesting. Everything is still a bit tricky for me since I'm not very used to R yet.
